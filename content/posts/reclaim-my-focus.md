## reclaim my focus

So many things to do. So many things to learn, to improve, to enjoy. I always love to dive into new stuff, but sometimes nothing comes out my hands. This happens at work also, sometimes I just keep staring at the task at hand. I can't focus. My head seems full and I can't see the forest for the trees. I can't think about one thing because I'm preoccupied by the other. I want that to stop. I want to reclaim my focus.

## what claims my focus now

* thoughts, daily life, worries
* social media

## dropping bad habits
* leasure/sports/downtime/offline
  
## structure

* work/life
 
## mindfullness/sports

## new things!

## reclaim my focus

So many things to do. So many things to learn, to improve, to enjoy. I always love to dive into new stuff, but sometimes nothing happens. I can't focus. My head seems full although and see the forest for the trees. I can't think about one thing because I'm preoccupied by the other. I want that to stop. I want to reclaim my focus.
